# naughts-and-crosses
An implementation of the classic naughts &amp; crosses game

To Do on main:
* ~~center text in boxes~~
* ~~display whose turn it is~~
* ~~fill in about~~
* ~~call endGame if all squares are full and no winner~~

To Do on AI branch:
* implement computer algorithm
    * find/develop algorithm (p2)
        * mini-max algorithm to recursively analyse all moves is popular
    * pseudocode algorithm
    * add AI option to player objects
    * code up AI algorithm into function in GameEngine
    * add UI element choice for AI in p2
    * add AI to initialize
    * link UI element to AI option in p2 object
    * call AI funtion in PlayRound after p1 instead of waiting for click to call GameEngine.playRound() for p2
    * debug and implement + test AI
* Add some transition animation/time so the player can have time to see the AI work. 



To Do on branch:
* display win counts
